            <h3>SAFETY AND SECURITY</h3>
            <p>The safety and security of our guests is our top priority. Our excellent record of safe operation throughout Carnival's 40-plus year history, and the comprehensive safety standards we continue to live up to every day, proves that commitment.
                Make sure you have proper clothing for all weather conditions. Please be prepared for adverse weather conditions and apply the mantra “better safe than sorry”. Have insurance in place so that the expenses for a helicopter emergency evacuation
                or other emergency situations are covered, if needed. Please bring the insurance details with you. Always bring you cell phone with you. It may not always catch connection when “out there”, but if it can and you need it, you’ll be glad
                you brought it. An alternative is to bring a satellite telephone (this is not a must though). Do not drink alcohol. It dehydrates you and thus increases the risk of altitude sickness if above 3,000 m. Always trek with a friend, or guide.
                While trekking above 3,000 m do not ascend too fast. Generally it is not recommended to ascend more than 3-500 m per day as doing so will significantly increase the risk of Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS). If possible, get some weather information
                enroute so as to not get caught in adverse weather circumstances.
